Grafana Loki and Promtail – Log Monitoring & Aggregation
Grafana Loki is a log aggregation system designed for storing and querying logs efficiently. Unlike traditional log systems like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Loki doesn’t index log content but instead indexes labels (metadata), making it lightweight and cost-effective.

Promtail is an agent that collects logs from applications and forwards them to Loki.
